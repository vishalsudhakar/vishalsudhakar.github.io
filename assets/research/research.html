                    <h2>"SOFT EXCESS" IN X-RAY SPECTRUM OF ACTIVE GALATIC NUCLEI</h2>
                    <h3>Project Under Dr. David Ballantyne</h3>
                    <p>
                        Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs) are compact and highly energetic regions at the center of galaxies, powered by the accretion 
                        of material onto supermassive black holes. AGNs are characterized by their intense emission of various forms of radiation, 
                        including X-rays, ultraviolet, visible light, and radio waves. Studying AGNs is essential for understanding extreme astrophysical 
                        processes, the evolution of supermassive black holes, and the impact of AGNs on their host galaxies.<br><br>

                        As part of this project, I performed numerical calculations written using Python and its necessary packages to extend the 
                        range of the reXcor model formulated by  <a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/mnras/stac1646" class="link">Xiang et al</a>. 
                        The reXcor combines two primary models, the warm corona model and the ionized relativistic reflection model, to describe 
                        the "soft excess" in the X-ray spectrum of AGNs. A total of 8 model grids were created for various model parameters and black 
                        hole properties, such as spin. I used the created model grids and Xspec, an X-ray spectral fitting package, to fit the reXcor 
                        model to 32 XMM-Newton observations for type-I AGNs. An example of the X-ray spectrum and the model fit for AGN Mrk279 is shown 
                        to the right. <br><br>

                        We are currently writing a paper illustrating our findings, which will be published in the Monthly Notices of the Royal 
                        Astronomical Society journal in early 2024. Once the paper is accepted, a link to the paper will be updated here, providing a 
                        detailed description of the project.

                    <h2>RIGIDITY OF TENSEGRITY STRUCTURES - SQUARE LATTICE</h2>
                    <h3>Project Under Dr. Zeb Rocklin</h3>
                    <p>Many structures observed around the world, from bridges to cytoskeletons of cells, can be composed of two categories of 
                        elements: linear and non-linear. These systems are specified under a class of mechanical structures called tensegrities. 
                        Tensegrity structures consist of linear and two non-linear elements, Hookian springs, cables, and struts, respectively.<br><br>

                        In this project, I played a pivotal role in developing an analytical model using methods from graph theory to characterize 
                        the mechanical critical point, transition to full rigidity, and the "avalanche" behavior of a square-backbone-lattice 
                        tensegrity. I particularly focused on two critical aspects: in-depth exploration of "avalanche" behavior and the extension 
                        of these to a generic square lattice. Tensegrity structures exhibit a remarkable behavior where adding a single non-linear 
                        element can instantly eliminate a significant number of degrees of freedom, often referred to as "floppy modes." An example 
                        of such behavior in the mathematical graph space is shown here. <br><br>
                        
                        To tackle this complex challenge, I meticulously crafted code using both Mathematica and Python to quantify the probability 
                        of "avalanches" of various sizes, given specific initial conditions of the system. This computational approach allowed me to 
                        rigorously test the analytical form of the probability, which I actively contributed to shaping. Furthermore, I extended this 
                        theory to a generic square-backbone lattice. I used my understanding of linear algebra in abstract vector spaces and my programming 
                        skills to measure the probability of rigidity of a generic square-backbone lattice and thus its mechanical critical point. <br><br>

                        We have a written a paper with our results which has been accepted in the prestigious PNAS journal, with publication imminent. 
                        A manuscript of the <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.04004.pdf" class="link">paper</a> is already available on the arXiv database.

                    <h2>EQUATIONS OF STATE OF NEUTRON STARS - A REVIEW</h2> 
                    <h3>Project for Graduate High Energy Astrophysics Class</h3>
                    <p> 
                        During my final year of undergraduate studies, I enrolled in a graduate-level High Energy Astrophysics class that covered a 
                        range of topics, including astrophysical fluid dynamics, accretion onto compact objects, and clusters of galaxies. As part 
                        of this course, I undertook an independent research project.<br><br>

                        For my project, I delved into the Equations of State (EOS) for Neutron Stars. I explored the historical discovery of 
                        neutron stars, their theoretical development, and how to constrain these EOS using observational data. I also wrote a 
                        review article that explained the process of deriving an EOS, highlighting the core's internal structure, 
                        neutron degeneracy, and quantum effects. I discussed the Brueckner-Bethe-Goldstone (BBG) theory and three approaches 
                        to solving the two-nucleon Hamiltonian.<br><br>

                        To validate these theoretical concepts, I conducted numerical calculations using Python, solving relativistic 
                        hydrodynamical equations for three distinct EOS models given by Wiringa et al. (1988) and their fit functions by Kutschera & Kotlorz (1993). 
                        This allowed me to determine the mass and radius of neutron stars as functions of baryon density. These properties provided insights into 
                        the EOS's accuracy, which I compared with real-world observations, such as the mass-versus-radius data of two neutron stars, 
                        PSR J0740+6620 and PSR J0030+0451, shown to the right.<br><br>

                    <h2>MACHINE LEARNING / AI</h2>
                    <p>In recent times, machine learning and artificial intelligence have become essential tools in various fields, 
                        including physics. As I continue my journey to understand the fundamentals of these subjects, I've undertaken 
                        several projects that align with the concepts covered in the Udemy classes I'm taking. One of my ongoing projects 
                        is the development of a self-driving car that can learn from its environment and autonomously navigate to achieve 
                        specific goals.<br><br>

                        Currently, I have completed a simulation of the car's environment, complete with yellow lines representing the 
                        boundaries the car must stay within. The 'brain' of the robot consists of a Deep Q-Learning neural network implemented 
                        using Python and the PyTorch package. My next steps involve transitioning this simulation to a real 2WD car, similar 
                        to Wall-E. I'm using an ultrasonic sensor as the car's 'eyes' to map the terrain ahead and I'm in the process of learning 
                        how to analyze the 2D grid using machine learning algorithms. Once I'm able to use the map to calculate physical 
                        quantities, I can develop a cost function through which the car can learn and adapt to its environment.<br><br>
                        
                        This project not only enhances my understanding of the utility of machine learning but also extends to the analysis of 
                        multi-wavelength observations of celestial objects. I believe that these observations contain hidden details that can be 
                        extracted using such algorithms. Many researchers have already made substantial progress in this field, and I'm eager to 
                        contribute to these efforts.<br><br>
                        
                        As I make more progress in this endeavor, I will continue to update this section with additional content.
