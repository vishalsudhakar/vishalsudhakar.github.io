                    <h2>RIGIDITY OF TENSEGRITY STRUCTURES - SQUARE LATTICE</h2>
                    <h3>Project Under Dr. Zeb Rocklin</h3>

                            Many structures observed worldwide, from bridges to cell cytoskeletons, are composed of two categories of elements: linear and non-linear. 
                            These systems fall under the class of mechanical structures known as tensegrities. Tensegrity structures consist of linear and two non-linear 
                            elements, specifically Hookian springs, cables, and struts, respectively. In a pure linearly constrained system, the emergence of rigidity in 
                            the bulk is predicted by Calladineâ€™s extension of Maxwell's Count. The rigidity percolation transition considers the ability of a system to 
                            support external loads and is geometric in nature due to the directional constraints of the edges. These transitions exhibit both first and 
                            second-order characteristics. In this project, I played a pivotal role in developing an analytical model using methods from graph theory to 
                            characterize the mechanical critical point, transition to full rigidity, and "avalanche" behavior of a square-backbone-lattice tensegrity.
                            My particular focus was on two critical aspects: in-depth exploration of "avalanche" behavior and the extension of these findings to a generic 
                            square lattice. <br><br>
                            
                            To mathematically represent the physical system, we utilized bi-partite graphs. In such graphs, there are two types of nodes, which we refer 
                            to as row nodes and column nodes. A single square-backbone (pore) in the physical system has one row node and one column node in graph space. 
                            The linear and non-linear elements within a pore are represented by bi-directional and unidirectional arrows, respectively. 
                            Any row node and column node in the graph space can be connected by unidirectional arrows or bi-directional arrows. Naturally, a unidirectional 
                            arrow can have two orientations, upstream or downstream from a node. The direction of such arrows is determined by the orientation of the non-linear 
                            elements in the physical system. Below is an example of the mathematical representation of the physical system. In the bi-partite graph, clusters 
                            begin to form when sets of row and column nodes form closed loops, as shown below. These clusters represent rigid areas in the physical system, 
                            meaning that when a single pore is deformed, all the pores within the cluster deform equally. As elements are added to the system, a "giant" 
                            cluster begins to form, as shown in the second image below. <br><br>

                            Tensegrity structures exhibit a remarkable behavior where adding a single non-linear element can instantly eliminate a significant number of 
                            degrees of freedom, often referred to as "floppy modes." An example of such behavior in the mathematical graph space is shown above. The green 
                            nodes represent a rigid subset ("giant" cluster) of the system. When the dashed arrow, indicating an addition of a non-linear element, is introduced, 
                            the seven red nodes become part of the rigid subset, eliminating their degrees of freedom. Hence, we observe that a large part of the system initially 
                            "floppy" can become rigid. We quantified the probability of 'avalanches' of specific sizes by employing graph theory techniques and analyzing the statistics 
                            of node connections in a bi-partite graph. To tackle this complex challenge numerically, I meticulously crafted code using both 
                            Mathematica and Python to quantify the probability of "avalanches" of various sizes, given specific initial conditions of the system. 
                            This computational approach enabled a rigorous examination of the analytical probability model, to which I made significant contributions in its development. <br><br>
                            
                            In reality, most tensegrity systems don't always involve a square backbone. Hence, it was important to extend our results to generic systems. 
                            An example of a generic square lattice is shown above. In such generic tensegrity systems, two conditions must be satisfied: first, the system 
                            is rigid when non-linear elements are replaced with linear elements, and second, the state of the self-stress vector for the non-linear elements 
                            must have a "proper" sign, indicating tension. I applied my understanding of linear algebra in abstract vector spaces and my programming skills to 
                            measure the probability of rigidity for a generic square backbone lattice and thus determine its mechanical critical point. <br><br>
                            
                            A more detailed explanation of the methods and results can be found in our paper, which has been accepted in the PNAS journal with imminent publication.
