                    <div class="parag1">
                        <p>
                            In my final year of undergraduate studies, I enrolled in an advanced course on High Energy Astrophysics at the 
                            graduate level. This course provided a comprehensive exploration of high-energy astrophysical phenomena and the 
                            associated physical environments. Topics covered included astrophysical fluid dynamics, specifically examining 
                            phenomena such as shocks and blast waves, accretion processes onto compact astronomical objects, and the properties 
                            of galaxy clusters.<br><br>
                            
                            A subset of this class was to perform independent research and understand a topic of related to the class. For my research 
                            endeavor, I chose to investigate the development of Equations of State (EOS) for Neutron Stars. Neutron stars, which became 
                            a subject of considerable scientific interest following Chandrasekhar's groundbreaking work in the 1930s, represented 
                            an ideal subject matter for exploration. Numerous prominent physicists, including Baade, Zwicky, and Landau, contributed to 
                            the initial understanding and predictions of these intriguing celestial bodies which I discuss in the review paper.<br><br>

                                My independent research project involved a multifaceted investigation into neutron stars, spanning their historical 
                                discovery, the theoretical evolution of their Equations of State, and the establishment of constraints on these equations 
                                through the analysis of observational data. The culmination of this project took the form of a comprehensive review article 
                                that elucidated the process of formulating an Equation of State. This process commenced with a profound comprehension of the 
                                internal structure of neutron stars, encompassing the fundamental aspects of neutron degeneracy and quantum mechanical 
                                effects within their cores. A notable illustration within the review article was the exploration of the Brueckner-Bethe-Goldstone (BBG) theory, 
                                which focuses on the interactions between pairs of nucleons within the neutron star's core. Furthermore, I presented and 
                                discussed three distinct methodologies that have been developed to obtain exact solutions to the two-nucleon Hamiltonian. <br><br>
        
                                The research journey culminated in numerical calculations performed utilizing Python to solve relativistic hydrodynamical 
                                equations. Specifically, I investigated three distinct Equations of State: AV14-UVII, UV14-UVII, and UV14-TN1, in order to 
                                derive the mass and radius of neutron stars as functions of baryon density. These fundamental physical properties, derived 
                                from the Equations of State, serve as critical indicators for assessing the viability and accuracy of the EOS when compared 
                                with empirical observations. To present the findings of this research comprehensively, I created a graphical representation that 
                                shows the mass-versus-radius relationship of a neutron star with empirical measurements derived from two notable neutron stars, 
                                PSR J0740+6620 and PSR J0030+0451, shown above.<br><br>
